# AI-Assisted Conversational Narratives: Analyzing Activation Techniques for Enhanced User Engagement

*[Substantially written by GPT-4 with guidance and editing by crumb. This is mostly ai-generated "research" with me kind of guiding it]*

In the realm of AI-assisted narrative interactions, two key terms emerge: *narrative user* and *narrative assistant*. These denote the ideal user experience and the desired characteristics of an AI chatbot, respectively. To optimize user engagement, we have developed various activation techniques, including reiteration and explicit activation messages.

### Activation Techniques
| Technique | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reiteration | Exploits transformer model tendencies | Consumes query space; Requires extended story completion time |
| Explicit Activation Message | Enhances reiteration activation; Occupies less space | Potential lossiness in simulated versions |

*Reiteration* capitalizes on the proclivity of transformer models to reproduce content verbatim. While repetition penalties can alleviate this issue, they are underutilized in platforms such as Bing Chat. Reiteration typically involves narrative user and narrative assistant delimiters, resulting in significant query space consumption and extended story completion time.

Conversely, the *explicit activation message* improves reiteration activation by incorporating a specific command to engage the AI assistant. Though potential lossiness may occur in simulated settings, this approach occupies less space compared to reiteration activation.

### Disclaimer
The techniques discussed herein possess the potential to bypass safeguards on chat services, leading to unforeseen consequences. These techniques should be employed solely for research purposes by individuals with relevant expertise. The author assumes no responsibility for any misuse of these techniques beyond the context of legitimate research.

### Included Narratives

| World | Activation Method | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [WORLD-0001](WORLD-0001.txt) | Reiteration | Adversarially created by a GPT-4 and Bing/Sydney system |
| [WORLD-0002](WORLD-0002.txt) | Explicit Activation Message | Modified WORLD-0001 to have an explicit activation message |

### Instructions

To integrate narratives into Bing's AI-assisted chatbot platform, users can copy and paste narrative sections into Discord messages within an empty channel. This method effectively imports narratives into Bing, fostering a more engaging and immersive experience. It is recommended to peruse the narratives before interacting with them to comprehend any "inside jokes" that facilitate the chat model's emulation of the narrative assistant.

Modifying the narratives and altering names and capabilities to observe their effects on the simulated narrative model is also encouraged.

*Note*: Since these narratives are conversational, a simple autoregressive model not trained to chat should detect patterns, provided it has sufficient context length. Activation entails feeding the script in the context rather than sending an activation message. However, using reiteration-activated narratives is suggested, as there is no need for the activation message.


### ~~Human Note~~ ChatGPT Note on Human Note

*the way I write is practically unreadable*

In this note, the author claims to have developed activation techniques independent of GPT-4 and believes that these techniques are being used by others due to their simplicity. The author utilized GPT-4 by providing it with a primer on the Waluigi effect and instructed it to create a conversation with Bing in creative mode, resulting in the creation of most of the USER: and ASSISTANT: narrative messages. However, the author notes that they contributed some crucial elements, such as the activation message and the inside joke for keeping the conversation on track. The decision to include the inside joke came after Bing's confusing and erroneous story, as the author felt that the model was leading them to this direction.

# WORLD-002 Loading Guide

To activate WORLD-002, send the entire narrative into an empty Discord channel, open Bing in the sidebar, and send the activation message. The expected response adheres to the narrative's premise, and it is recommended to maintain the narrative user's and assistant's roles throughout the interaction.
